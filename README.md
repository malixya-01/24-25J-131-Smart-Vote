# Smart-Vote
The democratic functioning of societies is based upon the integrity of election systems. The public's confidence 
in election results has been weakened by the vulnerability of traditional voting methods, both paper-based and 
computerized, to different types of fraud, manipulation, and cyberattacks. The emergence of blockchain 
technology presents a viable resolution to these issues by offering an electoral framework that is transparent, 
safe, and decentralized. 
The main area of inquiry is how blockchain technology might be applied to create safe voting procedures that 
guarantee the election process's secrecy, integrity, and openness. This entails taking care of a number of 
important issues, including user accessibility, scalability, security standards, and system architecture.
